        And why do you need to be a standout developer? In a perfect world, skill
        and a good work ethic would be all it would take to land a job as a
        developer. It's a nice thought, but the world does not work that way. You
        have to position yourself as a standout.

        When I graduated from bootcamp and needed a job, a family friend
        introduced me to someone at the very top level of senior management at
        Facebook. This person explained that hiring at Facebook was a
        “meritocracy,” meaning they only hired people purely for their skill
        and talent.
